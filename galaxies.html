			<div><p>Galaxies are star systems with supermassive black holes in their centers. There are four main classifications of galaxies: The spiral galaxy with it's spiraling arms, elliptical with it's elliptoid shape, lenticular with am outer ring but no arms, and irregular for not fitting under any of these categories. Spiral galaxies have two different sub-types, being barred and unbarred where barred means the galaxy's arms have a bar that connectes the arms through its central bulge. </p> </div>

	<div><h2>The Hubble tuning fork</h2>
	<p> <b>Hubble's tuning fork</b> was used to classify galaxies into specific sub-types to better understand and detmine the age of the galaxy. With spirals, the older they get, the looser and messier looking their arms will appear, while ellipticals will become less round and more of an ellipsed shape as they age. Lenticular galaxies are classified as an "S0" on the tuning fork because they are the transition from elliptical to spiral.  </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Spiral galaxy</h2>
	<p> This is an image of the Milky Way's neighboring galaxy, <i>Andromeda</i>. <i>Andromeda</i> is a <b>barred spiral galaxy</b>, it is 260,000 light years across, and it is 10.1 billion years old, only 3.60 billion years younger than the Milky Way. <b>Spiral galaxies</b> are the most common type of galaxy to be seen, and they can be classifed by their arms connecting the outter ring to the central bulge. There are two sub-types of spiral galaxy: unbarred and barred with barred being predominantly more common. </p> </div>

	<div><h2>Ellipctical galaxy</h2>
	<p><i>Messier 87</i> is a type e0 <b>elliptical galaxy</b>, which means it's fairly young, and it is about 55 million light years away from Earth in the Virgo constellation. It is estimated to be 132,000 light years across, and it is the galaxy from which we got the first image of a black hole from. Elliptical galaxies have no arms or disk, to differentiate them from lenticular and spiral galaxies, but still having a central bulge where a supermassive black hole resides to differentiate from irregular galaxies. The younger an <b>elliptical galaxy</b>, the less elliptoid they appear, as they age they will begin to form that elliptoid shape. </p>

		<div><h2>Irregular galaxy</h2>
	<p> The <i>Magellanic clouds</i> are two <b>irregular galaxies</b>. The <i>large Magellanic cloud</i> is 32,300 light years aross, while the small one is 18,900 light years across. <b>Irregular galaxies</b> do not fit any qualities to resemble a spiral, elliptical, or lenticular galaxy, but still contain a supermassive black hole to differentiate them from a nebula. <b>Irregular galaxies</b> are the least common type of galaxy, making up 3% of all galaxies in the universe.  </p> </div>

	<div><h2>Lenticular galaxy</h2>
	<p>The <i>Cartwheel galaxy</i> is a <b>lenticular ring galaxy</b>. The galaxy is located in the Sculptor constellation 489.2 million light years away from Earth, with a distance of 150,000 light years across. The <i>Cartwheel galaxy</i> is relatively young compared to other galaxies, at 400 million years old. <b>Lenticular galaxies</b> are a mix of elliptical and spiral galaxies, having the ring and center bulge, but no arms like a spiral, while having little star formation like an elliptical galaxy. </p>

		<div><h2>Merging galaxies</h2>
	<p>  Two <b>colliding</b> spiral <b>galaxies</b> don't make an even larger spiral galaxy as one might think, they instead form an ellipcital galaxy because of gravitational forces. The <i>mice galaxies</i> are actually two different galaxies colliding into one-another, and over time they will eventually merge, becoming an elliptical galaxy. These galaxies are located 300 million light years from Earth, and all-together have a distance spanning 760,000 light years across.  </p> </div>
