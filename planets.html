		<div><p>The reason the planets are in the order they are is thanks to the Sun's solar wind. The rocky planets are more dense, therefore they were not pushed out as far as the gas planets. Pluto, despite not being a gas planet but an 'ice' planet, is further out from it's placement inside the Kuiper belt, which is why it was declassified to a dwarf planet.</p>  </div>

	<div> <h2>Mercury</h2>
	<p> Mercury is the first planet in our solar system, and the smallest, only being a little bigger than Earth's moon with craters just like it. It has no moons, no rings, and no tilt. It also has no atmosphere and instead has a very thin exosphere. The small planet is 43.38 million miles from the sun, and 48 million miles from Earth. In order to Mercury, one must look for it as the sun is setting as it's too close to be seen seperately like the other planets. </p>
		 </div>
		</div>
		
	<div class="flex-container">
		<div><h2>Venus</h2>
	<p>Venus is the second planet in our solar system, and despite not being the closest to the sun its the hottest. Because of its atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide the planet has really high greenhouse gasses that trap all heat that enter its atmosphere meaning it has a temperature of over 800 degrees fahrenheit. A year on Venus is 225 Earth days, while a day is 243 Earth days, making it take longer to complete a day than to complete a year.</p> </div>

		<div><h2>Earth</h2>
	<p>Earth is the third planet in our solar system, and the planet we live on. It has a tilt of 23 degrees which is the reason for the seasons we have, and 1 moon which could possibly be evidence as to why the planet has a tilt. The oly planet in the solar system to be able to host life, as any other planet is inhabitable due to atmosphere, or the lack of, or overall uninhabitable conditions. As most people know, 70% of the Earth's surface is water.</p> </div>

		<div class="flex-container">
			<div><h2>Mars</h2>
	<p>Mars is the fourth planet in our solar system, and the only planet to be fully inhabited by robots. With how many rovers and space crafts scientists have sent to Mars to study the planet, it makes Mars the only planet to have a population of only robots. Mars has 2 moons, no rings, and a tilt of 25 degrees, similar to Earth’s tilt; and because of this tilt, Mars also has polar caps. A day on Mars is 24 hours, 37 minutes, very similar to Earth while its orbital period ismuch longer at687 days. </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Jupiter</h2>
	<p>Jupiter is the 5th planet in our solar system,  and the largest. It’s a gas planet, and even though not as visible as Saturn’s, all gas planets have rings, including Jupiter. The planet has an astounding 95 moons in it’s orbit, and a tilt of 3 degrees, similar to Venus, which makes sense when taking the planets mass into consideration and that any collisions would have to be from objects just as massive as the planet. The iconic red eye onthe planet is actually a really large storm on the planet's surface, with a diameter 15,400 miles across. </p> </div>
		 </div>
	
		<div class="flex-container">
			<div><h2>Saturn</h2>
	<p>Saturn is the 6th planet in our solar system, and the most recognisable from it’s signature rings. The rings are made up of ice chunks, and rocks. An even more outstanding number than Jupiter, Saturn has 146 moons in it’s orbit and a tilt of 27 degrees. </p> </div>

			<div><h2>Uranus</h2>
	<p>Uranus is the 7th planet in our solar syster, and it’s only had 1 space craft, NASA’s Voyager 2, to ever visit and photograph it. Like the other gas planets, Uranus also has rings, however its rings are sideways as compared to the others because of it’s tilt of 98 degrees, meaning the planet is leaning on it's side rather than upright like it's neightbors. Uranus only has 27 moons, no where near as many as Saturn or Jupiter. A year for Uranus is an astounding 84 Earth years. </p> </div>
			 </div>
	
		<div class="flex-container">
			<div><h2>Neptune</h2>
	<p>Neptune is the 8th, and final, planet in our solar system. It has 16 moons in it’s orbit, and a tilt of 30 degrees, and it’s known as the blue giant for its deep blue coloration. Like Uranus, the only space craftto ever have visited the blue giant was NASA's Voyager 2 craft. Even more outstanding than Uranus, a full year for Neptune is 165 Earth years, while a day is only 16 hours and sometimes during its orbit its further from the sun than Pluto.  </p> </div>

			<div><h2>Pluto</h2>
	<p>Pluto is no longer considered a planet from it's inability to clear it's orbit, however it met the other classifications to be considered a planet (Having enough mass to maintin a round shape, and an orbit around the sun.) A full day on Pluto is 153 hours while translates to 6 days on Earth, while a year is 248 Earth years making it definitely the longest to orbit the sun. Pluto is thought to have an ocean underneath its layer of ice, having been frozen over due to its distance from the sun making it the coldest planet in the solar system. </p> </div>
