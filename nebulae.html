		<div><p>Nebulae are described as being the birthplace of stars, or star nurseries, because baby stars will form inside them from the condensed gasses. There are 5 main classifications of nebulae: Emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, dark nebulae, planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. The death of a star can also cause the beginning of a nebula, such as supernova remnants and planetary nebulae.</p> </div>

	<div><h2>Emmision nebula</h2>
	<p>The <i>Pillars of Creation</i> are apart of a larger nebula known as the <i>Eagle nebula</i>, and stretches to roughly 4 to 5 light years tall. The <i>Eagle nebula</i> spans 70 by 55 lightyears located in the constellation Serpens 7,000 light years from Earth, and it's relatively young only being 5.504 million years old as compared to our sun. <b>Emmision nebulae</b> are formed when nearby radiation from hot stars energize the ionized gasses, making the nebulae emit their own light at varied wavelengths. This nebula can produce stars whose temperatures exceed 20,000 K, which is 35540.33 farenheit, which is really hot.</p>

	<div><h2>Supernova remnant nebula</h2>
	<p>The <i>Crab nebula</i> is a <b>supernova remnant nebula</b> found in the Taurus constellation 6,523 Light Years from the planet Earth. The nebula is 11 light years across, having formed 1,001 years ago. The light from the supernova that formed the <i>Crab nebula</i> used to be visible to the naked eye, but it has since faded and it now requires a telescope to view it. Supernova remnant nebulae form after a massive star's pressure drops and the star collapses causing it to explode in a supernova, then the structure of a <b>supernova remnant</b> forms from the leftover material expanding from the explosion. </p>

	<div><h2>Planetary nebula</h2>
	<p>The <i>Butterfly nebula</i> is a <b>planetary nebula</b> found in the Scorpius constellation 3,392 Light Years from the planet Earth. The nebula is 3 light years across, having initially formed around 2,200 years ago. <b>Planetary nebula</b> typically have a ring shape, but some have an hourglass or wing-like shape, and they form when a lower-mass star comes to the end of its life cycle and instead of exploding in a supernova, it blows off its outer layers after running out of fuel to burn, leaving behind an approximately Earth-sized white dwarf star in the center of a <b>planetary nebula</b>. The central stars of a <b>planetary nebula</b> tend to be the hottest in the universe with temperatures reaching 25,000 to over 200,000 degrees Celsius. </p> </div>

	<div><h2>Reflection nebula</h2>
	<p><i>NGC 1999</i>, or the <i>Cosmic keyhole nebula</i>, is a <b>reflection nebula</b>. It is approximately 1,500 light years from Earth in the Orion constellation, with a diamater less than a light year long at 0.9 light years across. <b>Reflection nebulae</b> are clouds of dust that reflect the light from nearby stars, rather than creating its own light or absorbing light entirely. They form when light from a neighbor dust cloud reflects it stars light onto it. These types of nebulae reflect because they cannot create light themseleves, so in order to see them, the light from outside sources have to reflect off of them to reveal them to us. They tend to appear more blue because the light scatters better than red light does.  </p>

	<div><h2>Dark nebula</h2>
	<p>In this image of the <i>Horsehead nebula</i>, we are zoomed in pretty close to the actual "horsehead" and there is an infrared filter used to make the stars behind the nebula visible. Infrared filtering is temperature based, which allows us to see things that cannot orignally be seen in visible light by using optical telescopes. The Horsehead nebula is located 1,500 light years away in the constellation Orion, and has a diamater of 13 light years. <b>Dark nebulae</b>, or absorption nebulae, absorb light, meaning they're dense which prevents the stars behind them from being seen through their clouds of dust and gas.  </p> </div>
