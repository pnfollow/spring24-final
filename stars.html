			<div><p>Stars are luminous balls of hot gas that follow a sequence throughout their life cycle that can determine what type of star they’ll turn out to be or how the’ll inevitably explode. There are six main types of stars: main sequence stars, red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, red dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. Constellations are a collection of stars forming a pattern that people have created stories and backstories for their origins.</p> </div>

	<div><h2> Life cycle of a star</h2>
	<p> This diagram depicts the cycle in which stars go through throughout the course of their lives, beginning in a nebula. Massive stars tend to only live for around 10-20 million years due to their mass, and the fact that they use up their fuel at a faster rate than a less massive star while average stars are reported to be able to live up to trillions of years. </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Hertzsprung-Russel diagram</h2>
	<p> The Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, or HR diagram for short, is a diagram showcasing the relationship between a stars luminosity or absolute magnitude and it's temperature. This diagram shows where stars will be depending on their mass, temperate and luminosity, seeing as supergiants tend to run hotter and threfore appear higher on the chart being hotter and more luminous as compared to some main sequence stars. White dwarf stars don't tend to be lumious despite being mostly hot, as they are significantly smaller compared to main sequence and giant stars.   </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Main sequence star</h2>
	<p>Vega is a main sequence star and the head star of the constellation Lyra, and long ago it used to be the nothern star before Polaris. At the end of its lifespan, a main sequence star will evolve into a red giant before it inevitably sheds its outer layers to become a planetary nebula with a white dwarf in its center. A majority of the stars in our universe are main sequence stars, as becoming a massive star takes a lot of energy and fuel to supply.  </p>

		<div><h2>Red supergiant star</h2>
	<p> UY Scuti is the largest observed star in our universe, being 1,700 times larger than the sun in our solar system. Along with UY Scuti, red supergiant stars, in general, are recorded as being the largest stars in the universe. Red supergiants evolve from massive stars, and don't last long before they explode in a supernova.  </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Blue supergiant star</h2>
	<p> Rigel is one of the brightest stars in the sky in the constellation Orion, approximately 870 light years from the sun. Blue supergiants are lower mass than red supergiants, but they will expand into red supergiants where they will then follow the life cycle of a red supergiant. They are exthremely hot and luminous making them some of the hotteststars in the universe.  </p>

		<div><h2>Red giant star</h2>
	<p> Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, and depsite being larger than the sun in our solar system it has a lower surface temperature than it. Red giants are the stage after an average star when the fuel for nuclear fusion runs out and the star begins dying. Red giants will typically last for a billion years before shedding their outer layer, turning into a planetary nebula with a white dwarf at its center.  </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Red dwarf star</h2>
	<p>Barnard's star is a red dward star in the constellation Ophiuchus, 5.978 light years from Earth. Red dwarf stars are very low mass stars, with low fusions and low temperatures making them emit very little light. The most massive last billions of years, while the smallest can last up to trillions of years due to low fusion rates so they last for a pretty long time. </p>

		<div class="flex-container">
		<div><h2>Brown dwarf star</h2>
	<p> Brown dwarf stars are actually labelled as "failed stars," meaning their nuclear fusion failed to jumpstart a star, but they remained massive enough to be classified differently from a planet as they're still 12 to 70 times more massive than Jupiter.  </p> </div>

		<div><h2>White dwarf star</h2>
	<p>Sirius B, the smaller star in this artists rendition of Sirius A next to Sirius B, is only 7,500 miles in diameter, making it small compared to most other stars as it is the remnants of a dying star.</p>

		<div><h2>Black hole</h2>
	<p> This image of a supermassive black hole is the center of the galaxy Messier 87, with a mass equal to six and a half billion suns. Black holes are one of two fates that can befall a massive star upon its explosive death when the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses in on itself. The gravitation region around a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape its force. </p> </div>

		<div><h2>Neutron star</h2>
	<p>Neutron stars are the another way that a massive star can explode, where instead of collapsing in on itself, it collapses every proton and electron turning them into a neutron. If the explosion were more massive, then it would have collapsed in on itself into a black hole instead, so the fate is dependent on the mass of the explosion. Many neutron stars can be found inside supernova remnant nebulae, much like the image of a neutron star found inside the Crab nebula.  </p>
